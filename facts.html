            <h3>Playing Possum</h3>
            <p>
              An opossum, when confronted with a threat, will often hiss or bare
              its teeth. Or more likely, run. But if it is surprised by a
              predator, it will enter a catatonic state. It basically faints and
              is in a state of unconsciousness. The opossum has no control over
              this; it’s involuntary.

            <h3>All Thumbs</h3>
            <p>
              Just like humans and other primates, the opossum has the
              equivalent of opposable thumbs. Called a hallux, each of the
              opossum’s big toes on its hind feet are opposable; they stand
              apart from the other toes in a way that looks very similar to a
              human hand and thumb.

            <h3>New Neighbors?</h3>
            <p>
              you should welcome Opossums to live nearby. Opossums are an
              incredible asset to a garden. They eat a multitude of pests, from
              snails and insects to rodents and venomous snakes.
